## Lab Format
Each lab is documented using a consistent structure:
- **Objective** – What the lab is testing or simulating
- **Environment** – Tools, platforms, and scope
- **Investigation / Configuration Steps**
- **Findings or Results**
- **Mitigation & Security Recommendations**
- **Lessons Learned**

This format mirrors real-world SOC reporting and security documentation standards.

## Tools & Technologies
- Windows 10 / 11
- Windows Event Viewer
- Microsoft Defender concepts
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- PowerShell (basic administrative usage)
- Virtual lab environments

## Disclaimer
All labs in this repository are performed in **isolated lab environments**.  
No production systems, employer environments, or sensitive information are documented.
