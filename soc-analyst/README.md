\# SOC Analyst Labs



This section contains hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) style labs focused on detection, investigation, and incident response.



The labs in this section simulate real-world analyst workflows, emphasizing log analysis, alert triage, and security decision-making rather than offensive techniques.



\## Skills Demonstrated

\- Security event log analysis

\- Alert triage and prioritization

\- Incident investigation methodology

\- Risk assessment and impact analysis

\- Clear security documentation and reporting



\## Lab Topics

\- Windows Security Event Log investigations

\- Suspicious authentication activity

\- Privileged access monitoring

\- Endpoint security alerts

\- Incident response fundamentals



\## Analyst Workflow Emphasized

Each lab follows a structured SOC-style approach:

1\. Identify and validate the alert or anomaly

2\. Collect relevant logs and data

3\. Correlate events across sources

4\. Assess risk and potential impact

5\. Recommend mitigation and prevention steps

6\. Document findings clearly for stakeholders



\## Why This Matters

SOC analysts must be able to explain \*what happened\*, \*why it matters\*, and \*what should be done next\*.



These labs focus on developing that analytical and communication skillset, which is critical in real operational environments.



\## Disclaimer

All labs are conducted in isolated lab environments.  

No production systems or employer environments are documented.
